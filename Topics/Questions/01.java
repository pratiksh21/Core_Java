--------------why class does not support multiple inheritance while interfaces does ?

Now, think of class as the blueprint for making these toy cars. Each class tells us what powers (or methods) a toy car has. But in Java, when you make a new toy car, it can only get powers from one blueprint (or class).

------------Step 1: Let's Make a Fast Car!
We start with a simple car that can go really fast:

java
Copy code
class FastCar {
    void goFast() {
        System.out.println("Zoom! I'm going super fast!");
    }
}
------------Step 2: Let's Make a Noisy Car!
Now, let's make another car that can make noise:

java
Copy code
class NoisyCar {
    void makeNoise() {
        System.out.println("Vroom Vroom! I'm making noise!");
    }
}
------------Step 3: What If We Want a Car That Can Do Both?
In Java, if we want a car that can go fast and make noise, we can't directly combine both FastCar and NoisyCar to make a new supercar. Instead, we have to choose one class to inherit from. But we can use interfaces to give our car both powers.

Interface Time!
An interface is like a promise. It says, "Any car that uses me will have this power." Let's make two interfaces:

java
Copy code
interface CanGoFast {
    void goFast();
}

interface CanMakeNoise {
    void makeNoise();
}
------------Step 4: Build a Supercar That Does Both!
Now, weâ€™ll make a supercar that promises to go fast and make noise:

java
Copy code
class SuperCar implements CanGoFast, CanMakeNoise {
    public void goFast() {
        System.out.println("Zoom! I'm going super fast!");
    }

    public void makeNoise() {
        System.out.println("Vroom Vroom! I'm making noise!");
    }
}
------------Step 5: Play With Your Supercar!
Now, let's play with the SuperCar we just built:

java
Copy code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SuperCar mySuperCar = new SuperCar();
        mySuperCar.goFast();     // Output: Zoom! I'm going super fast!
        mySuperCar.makeNoise();  // Output: Vroom Vroom! I'm making noise!
    }
}
--------Summary:

Classes are like blueprints for toy cars, but you can only use one at a time.
Interfaces are like promises that say, "This car will have this power."
Java uses interfaces to give cars (or classes) more than one power.
Just like building and playing with toy cars, programming in Java is all about building things step by step!
